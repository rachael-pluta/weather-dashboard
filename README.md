# Weather Dashboard

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a five-day weather outlook for travellers so that they can plan their trip in particular cities accordingly.

## Installation

## Usage
The user can retrieve the current weather and the five-day weather outlook for that city by entering the name of the city in the search bar.

The user's search history is saved, so that they can click on the name of a city they previously searched to retrieve the weather information again.

If the user no longer requires the weather outlook for the searched cities, the user can click on the 'Clear Search History' button so that this information is no longer displayed.
